This file audits a direct fourth-moment replacement for the canonical sponsor
cube argument. With `n = 2^30` coordinates and `m = n+1` witnesses, use the
line-cap-three fact to say every four-distinct tuple has error union at least
`d+1`, while every tuple with at least two distinct indices has error union at
least `d+1-t` by the pair-union distance lemma. A one-index tuple contributes
the trivial lower bound zero.

The fourth-moment upper bound is the usual power-mean bound from errors of size
at most `t`. The theorem below computes the exact point where these two scalar
inequalities cease to contradict one another. This is only a limitation of
this direct fourth-moment argument, not a counterexample to the canonical code
or the prize statement.

/-- The distinct-fourth-moment bound has no contradiction above the incumbent
canonical floor: at the existing error budget, its upper moment already
dominates its strongest direct lower bound from pair-distance and line-cap
three. The positive `slack` is exact, not a floating-point approximation. -/

bad family, its error budget must exceed `170836173`. Thus this argument alone
cannot reach the existing first-sponsor floor `221512374`. -/
